is the currently recommended version of Groovy and requires JDK8 as a minimum.
The latest released version in the Groovy 2.5.x stream is recommended where JDK7 is required.

(\*) The 2.4.x stream is no longer the focus of the core team
but critical security fixes or community contributions may lead
to additional releases.

(**) While in early stages of pre-release, security fixes are
done on a best effort basis.
